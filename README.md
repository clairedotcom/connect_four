## Challenges & Lessons Learned

Building TDD Connect Four required the most pre-planning of my projects to date. In order to know what to test, I needed to plan out the purpose, input, and output of every method and every class.

The methods in my earliest projects are long chunks of code that do many things and have multiple inputs and outputs. That's hard to test well! Writing tests first taught me the importance of writing more methods that each serve only one purpose.

In future projects I'm going to write more thorough tests. In this project I wrote code that passed all of my tests, but my game didn't behave the way I expected. As a result, I had to debug edge cases that I hadn't anticipated when writing my initial tests.
