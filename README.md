## Challenges & Lessons Learned

Building TDD Connect Four required the most pre-planning of my projects to date. In order to know what to test, I needed to plan out the purpose, input, and output of every method in every class.

The methods in my earliest projects are long scripts that do many things and have multiple inputs and outputs. That's hard to test well! Writing tests before any code showed me the importance of writing a larger quantity of methods that each serve only one purpose.

Going forward I'd like to practice writing more thorough tests. In this project I wrote code that passed all of my tests, but my game didn't behave the way I expected.
